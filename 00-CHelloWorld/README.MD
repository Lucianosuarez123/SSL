In this folder we have two files where 
1. hello.c : Is a file programmed in lenguage C where It produces a message that says "hello world".
2. output.txt : Is a text with the compiler output of hello.c program.
How to use:
1) You need to have installed any source code editor that supports c language. You can install visual studio code or,in my case, installed Git Bash. For use c in visual studio check this link: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw.
  I installed visual studio code with Mingw64 and I installed git bash because for me It is a comfortable console for programming. 
2) 
Note: In this program we are using a version of the C11 compiler.
